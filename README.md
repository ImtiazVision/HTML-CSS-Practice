# HTML-CSS-Practice

The HTML anchor tag `<a>` defines a hyperlink that links one page to another page. The href attribute is the most important attribute of the HTML anchor tag that determines the linkâ€™s destination. Search engines use the anchor tag to decide the subject matter of the destination URL.

Here is a list of HTML5 page structure elements:

`<header>` - Used to specify a document's or section's header. 

`<nav>` - Defines a container for navigation links.

`<section>` - Defines a section within a document.

`<article>` - This tag is used to identify a self-contained, standalone article.

`<apart>` - Separately defines the content (just like a sidebar)

`<footer>` - This element is used to identify a footer within a document or section.

`<details>` - Used to specify any extra information

`<summary>` - This element is used to establish a heading within the details> element.
