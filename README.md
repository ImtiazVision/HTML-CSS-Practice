# HTML-CSS-Practice

The HTML anchor tag `<a>` defines a hyperlink that links one page to another page. The href attribute is the most important attribute of the HTML anchor tag that determines the linkâ€™s destination. Search engines use the anchor tag to decide the subject matter of the destination URL.

Here is a list of HTML5 page structure elements:

`<header>` - Used to specify a document's or section's header. 

`<nav>` - Defines a container for navigation links.

`<section>` - Defines a section within a document.

`<article>` - This tag is used to identify a self-contained, standalone article.

`<apart>` - Separately defines the content (just like a sidebar)

`<footer>` - This element is used to identify a footer within a document or section.

`<details>` - Used to specify any extra information

`<summary>` - This element is used to establish a heading within the details> element.

### Document Object Model (DOM)

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface (API) for HTML and XML applications. This describes the logical structure of a document as well as how to access and change it.

Using the **Document Object Model**, programmers may create documents, explore their structure, and add, change, or delete parts and information. Something included in an HTML or XML document may be read, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model.



The HTML **DOM** defines the objects and properties of all HTML elements, as well as the methods (interface) to access them.
